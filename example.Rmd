How to cross reference figures and tables using `bookdown`. 

Let's start by using a figure reference. 
This is done using `Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)` which would be Figure \@ref(fig:fig1).
A second figure would be Figure \@ref(fig:fig2).

Note that the numbering is dependent upon the position of the labeled R chunk. 
If you cut the second figure chunk, paste it above the first and recompile, the numbers will switch.

Can also reference tables using `Table \@ref(tab:tab1)` which would be Table \@ref(tab:tab1).

## Tables

```{r tab1}
knitr::kable(mtcars, 
             caption = "Summary of key management measures and the time series of catch, ABC, and TAC for northern rockfish in the Gulf of Alaska",
             booktabs = TRUE)
```

## Figures 

```{r fig1, fig.cap="A figure"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```


```{r fig2, fig.cap="Another figure"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth()
```

If you are calling figures that are already created it is best to use `knitr::include_graphics()`. 

````
```{r fig3, fig.cap="Estimated and observed long-term and recent commercial catch of northern rockfish in the Gulf of Alaska."}`r ''`

knitr::include_graphics(here::here(year, model, "figs", "catch.png"))
```
